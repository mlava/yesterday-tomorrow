This extension allows you to have buttons for Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow Daily Notes Pages added to your Roam Top Bar.

The extension will create the required DNP page if there isn't already one assigned to those dates.

You can choose to display Yesterday and Tomorrow as dates, using international or US styling if you prefer.

There is also an option to hide the text labels and only display the icons:

The buttons will automatically shrink to show only the icons with the text on smaller screen sizes.
